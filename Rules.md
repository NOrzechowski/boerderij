# The Official Rules of Bora
## Set up

Divide the chips evenly amongst the players. Lay out the 4 Casa cards in the center of the table with a pot in the middle.

Depending on the number of players remove the following cards from the deck:
3 -- 2C
5 -- 2C & 2S
6 -- 2C, 2D, 2H & 2S

Each player should place 1 chip on each Casa card
Deal all of the cards in deck to the players.

The player to the left of the dealer starts.

## Game Play


Players play one at a time in a clockwise fashion. On their turn, a player must either play a card or if they cannot legally do so pay the pot 1 chip. A card may be played if it is the next highest or next lowest card in the suit. If no card has yet been played on the suit the only valid card is a 7 of that suit. For example, if a 7H has been played both the 8H and 6H are valid cards that can be played.
 
If a Casa card is played, that player wins all the chips on the Casa card. 

The round ends when a player that plays all the cards in their hand. This player wins all the chips in the center pot.

Every player adds new chips to each of the Casa cards. (Note any chips from prior rounds remain on the Casa cards) and the new dealer deals the cards out.

## Game End

The game ends when one player has run out of chips. The player with the most chips wins.
